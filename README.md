# Why?
I'm an aspiring mechatronics student, and part of the problem  as someone taking mechatronics is the lack of colleges that offer it as a bachelors degree program. As a result, I've been comparing similar degrees on assist.org to see if I can find any similar programs, only to find such comparisions non-existent.

Thus, I'm building CaliXfer mainly for myself, so that I can figure out what degree/program is best for me, but also in the hopes that other people in a similar position as me can benefit from it.
