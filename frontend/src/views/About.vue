      <a href="assist.org">ASSIST</a> is a website for transfer students in California to roughly figure out what courses they
      should take in order to transfer to their dream 4-year college from a public community college. To quote, "It is intended
      to help students and counselors work together to establish an appropriate path toward transferring from a public California
      community college to a public California university."

    <div>
      Although ASSIST is designed to help students with figuring out transfer requirements, it's not as helpful when you either
      don't know which <b>college</b> to attend or what <b>major</b> to study, or even both. This has often resulted in students
      taking all the required courses for one major/college, only to realize that they either don't want to pursue that
      major/college or they didn't need to take all those courses, thus wasting time and money.

      This is where CaliXfer comes in: it provides a way to compare between different majors and/or universities with simplistic
      understand visuals and an easy to use interface. In other words, CaliXfer helps you in answering the following questions:
    </div>
    <br>

    <ol>
      <li>I know which <b>college</b> I want to attend and which <b>major</b> that I want to study, but I don't know my requirements needed to transfer...</li>
      <li>I know which <b>college</b> I want to attend, but I'm not sure which <b>major</b> is right for me...</li>
      <li>I know which <b>major</b> that I want to study, but I'm not sure which <b>college</b> is right for me...</li>
      <li>I don't know which <b>college</b> and <b>major</b> to choose...</li>
    </ol>
    <br>

    <div>
      I hope you find this website useful and helpful as I am finding, while attending DVC as of now. It's helped me gain a
      clearer understand of my career path and what I want to do in my life.
