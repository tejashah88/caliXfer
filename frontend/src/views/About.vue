        caliXfer is a web app that enhances some of assist.org's capabilities in an exploratory fashion. In addition to improving on some of the annoyances of assist.org, it let's you explore different major/university programs by comparing the differences in the course requirement agreements using easy-to-understand visuals. In other words, it let's you answer the following questions:
        <br>
        <br>
        <ol>
          <li>I know which <b>major</b> that I want to go for, but I'm not sure which <b>college</b> is right for me...</li>
          <li>I know which <b>college</b> I want to attend, but I'm not sure which <b>major</b> is right for me...</li>
        </ol>

      <div class="headline text-xs-left">
        "I am a college freshman studying for Mechatronics Engineering. I'm developing this website as part of figuring out where I want to go after community college, since at this time, mechatronics is not a well known field, and thus very few undergrad programs offered mechatronics engineering as a major. I wanted to compare other programs but assist.org doesn't provide such capabilities at the moment. I hope that whoever finds this website benefits from it by helping them take one step closer to figuring out their career."
